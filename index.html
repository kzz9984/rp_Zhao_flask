                        <p class="lead overview-font ovPadLeft">The interrelated factors of sleep, aging, and cognitive function are crucial areas of research in today’s society. Lower sleep quality and quantity have a detrimental effect on an individual’s health and cognitive function. In particular, negative effects on cognitive function, which include decreases in learning capability, are one of the first effects to occur following sleep deprivation. Previous research has demonstrated that aging plays a significant role in sleep, with both human and animal studies indicating that older age contributes to both reduced sleep quality and quantity. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate how age influences the effect of sleep deprivation on daytime function.</p>

                        <p class="lead overview-font ovPadRight">Sleep is currently one of the most mysterious fields in science, and many of its functions and mechanisms, especially those that interact with age, remain unclear. Further research in this field will make possible the eventual development of appropriate methods for treating aging individuals that suffer from a lack of sleep. This is currently an issue of great relevance, as around half of the elderly population claims to have difficulties with sleep, with 30-48% of the elderly claiming to have symptoms of insomnia. Additionally, it has been shown that sleep in old age is difficult to start and sustain. Therefore, gaining more information on the relationship between sleep deprivation, learning, and age is essential for improving the quality of life in older adults.

                        <p class="lead overview-font ovPadLeft">The spatial learning abilities of <em>Drosophila</em> were measured using a heat maze, which is a spatial learning assay where the fly must locate a cool tile in an otherwise warm environment with the aid of visual cues on the walls that pair with the location of the cool tile. Under normal conditions, flies can improve their time at locating the cool tile using the visual cues over several trials, and they are also capable of retaining visual place memories for several hours. Flies’ average times in the heat maze worsened if they had been deprived of sleep the night prior. The objective of the present study was to determine whether this decrease in learning ability observed with the sleep-deprived flies is affected by the age of the fly. Sleep deprivation was predicted to impair the spatial learning capabilities of older flies more than that of younger flies.
